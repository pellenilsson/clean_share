Clean Share
===========

A super simple JavaScript based row of static social share buttons,
for use on blogs and other web sites.

Currently these services are supported:

* E-mail
* Google+
* Facebook
* Twitter
* Tumblr
* LinkedIn
* Blogger

It is meant to use the free high quality `Social media icon set`__ by Dustin Stout,
but you can use any images you like.
